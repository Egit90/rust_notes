vars are either

- mutable => can be changed
- immutable => can't be changed

ğŸš€ vars are immutable by default

```
let my_number = 8;
println!(" My number is: {}", my_number);

my_number = 10; // ğŸ›‘ we can't vars are immutable by default
println!("My altered number is: {}" , my_number);
```

ğŸš€ To make a var mutable we use the "mut" word.

```
let mut my_number = 8;
println!(" My number is: {}", my_number);

my_number = 10; // âœ…
println!("My altered number is: {}" , my_number);
```
