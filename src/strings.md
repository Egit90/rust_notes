# <font color="green"> Strings </font>

- String

  - little slower.
  - has more functions.
  - it is a pointer with a data in the heap.
  - Owned type.
  - ```rust
    // we can create String like this:
    fn main(){
    let var = String::from("Hello, World");
    let var = "Elie".to_string();
    }
    ```

- &str
  - string slice
  - Simple String
  - `let var  = "hello, world";`
  - fast
  - "&" because it is a reference to use str.

üöÄ format! => Creates a String

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_name = "Billybrobby";
    let my_country = "USA";
    let my_home = "Korea";

    let _together = format!(
        "I am {} and I come from {} but I live in {}.",
        my_name, my_country, my_home
    );
}
```

üöÄ into! => makes an owned type.

```rust
// this will not work because Rust doesn't know which owned type you want. Many types can be made form a &str
fn main() {
    let my_string = "Try to make this a String".into(); // ‚ö†Ô∏è
}
```

```rust
fn main() {
    let my_string: String = "Try to make this a String".into(); // ‚úîÔ∏è
}
```
